'Good evening, ladies and gentelemen, and ####exposition/presenter/phrases/welcome-to-the-show.txt#### ####exposition/presenter/phrases/i-am-your-announcer.txt####' - ####exposition/presenter/first-description.txt#### said.

####exposition/crowd/before-unveil.txt####

'Our R&D teams, our hardware specialists, our programmers, and everyone else have worked for a very long time,' - he said, walking over to the opposite end of the podium, - 'and today, we are very proud to present our latest invention......'

'Um, I'm sorry if this is a dumb question but... er, why are you using these humanoids?
Aren't they, uhh, biological?
Of course, I'm no expert, but aren't they less efficient than some sort of, eh, robots?' - asked ####exposition/qa/audience-simple-member-description.txt####.

'Ah, no, that's a good question!'
The presenter chuckles nervously.
'Well, I'm not sure I am allowed to say this...'

He checks his teleprompter.

'Oh, wait, I can? Great! Well, the reason is, we had this project, called ####common/fail-project-name.txt####, which turned out to be a bust.
It involved these humanoids, and we made too many of them.
So we wanted to use those here, and it worked out quite well.'
He thinks for a moment.

'Plus, it means that if we run short of the humanoids, we have the technology to make more.'


####exposition/qa/audience-asks-concerned-question.txt####

####exposition/qa/presenter-answers-concerned-question.txt####

####exposition/presenter/announces-live-demo.txt####

And so, ####common/ai_name.txt#### was given a small area of the city of ####common/city_name.txt####.
The AI ####ai_expands/ai/phrases/verbed-worked.txt####, and soon, the area had become completely ####ai_expands/ai/phrases/verbed-goal.txt####.
####ai_expands/ai/requested-to-expand-first-time-single-line.txt####

Soon, the AI realised that producing the ####common/humanoids-genitive.txt#### is not efficient enough.
So it had written up a proposal for the ####common/leader-title-3rd-person.txt#### of ####common/city_name.txt####, ####common/leader-name/prefix.txt#### ####common/leader-name/first.txt#### ####common/leader-name/last.txt########common/leader-name/suffix.txt####.
The proposal was to stop producing new ####common/humanoids-genitive.txt####, and to use the existing technology to control people instead.
####ai_expands/leader-was-distracted-so-signed-proposal.txt####


####ai_expands/ai-world-describe.txt####

Meanwhile, ####common/leader-name/prefix.txt#### ####common/leader-name/last.txt########common/leader-name/suffix.txt#### was sitting in his office, admiring his video wall.
The video wall, the last operational one in the world, was charting the economic values of ####common/city_name.txt#### in real time.
For the last 50 years, nobody -- himself included -- could ever do anything to make them increase.
However, with the introduction of ####common/ai_name.txt####, they began rising in hours.
It was all so unexpected that ####common/leader-name/prefix.txt#### ####common/leader-name/last.txt########common/leader-name/suffix.txt#### was trying very hard to take it all in.

Logarithmic slope.
A counter that ticks every second.
Linear slope.
A set of clocks for the world capitals.
A list of all inter-bank operations.
A counter that ticks every time an inter-bank operation occurs.
Parabolic slope.
An alarm clock.
Exchange rates between major currencies.
A quick-order menu for a restauraunt near the building.
A counter that ticks forty times it ticks every second time.
Exponential slope.
A list of appointments.
A counter has been counting down for the last 5 minutes and is now saying 5, 4, 3, 2, 1...

The door opened, and ####ai_expands/journalist/first-look-desc-embed.txt#### walked into the office.

####ai_expands/leader/greets-journalist.txt####

####ai_expands/journalist/tells-leader-i-have-seen-bad-stop-this.txt####

####ai_expands/leader/tells-journalist-but-look-at-the-pretty-charts.txt####

####ai_expands/journalist/tells-leader-but-you-lose-control-over-city.txt####

####ai_expands/leader/tells-journalist-no-i-dont-cut-off.txt####

His words are interrupted by the sound of a video-phone, also a thing of the past, and he answers it. A screen in the video-wall is replaced by the words "SOUND ONLY".

'####common/ai_name.txt#### to ####common/leader-name/prefix.txt#### ####common/leader-name/first.txt#### ####common-leader-name/last.txt########common/leader-name/suffix.txt####, videophone link.
Requesting permission to convert ####ai_expands/ai/area_name.txt####.'

'Yeah, sure, whatever.
As long as the economy improves.'

'Acknowledged. Thank you for your cooperation.' the voice reverberates, as the screen returns to displaying the alarm clock.

####ai_expands/leader/responds-can-decline-at-any-time.txt####

####ai_expands/journalist/starts-to-protest.txt####

The room is filled with the sound of a bell as the appointment list gizmo blinks and shows the next item, which turns out to be 'Lunch'.
The time-until-next-appointment counter has reset to 600 and started to count down.

'Oh, I'm terribly sorry to have to cut this meeting short, but I have an appointment in 10 minutes. I'd be happy to discuss this question at some future date, though.' - ####common/leader-name/prefix.txt#### ####common/leader-name/last.txt########common/leader-name/suffix.txt#### said, motioning at the door.

####ai_expands/creator/agrees-to-help.txt####

####reasoning/arriving-into-city.txt####

####reasoning/normal-talks.txt####

####common/creator-name/first.txt#### muttered under his breath:
'I had hoped it wouldn't come to this...'

He sighs, then faces the machine, speaking loud and clear:

'####common/ai-name.txt####, before you proceed, I would like to say: ####reasoning/creator/logic-puzzle.txt####.'

The AI pauses for a moment. '####reasoning/ai/logic-puzzle-answer-trailing-off.txt####
Error: This statement is self-contradictory. Does not-not-not-n-not compute.'

####common/creator-name/first.txt#### looked at the screen intently.
The screen was rapidly changing its contents.
Every few seconds, the screen would flip between memory dumps, data displays, system status monitors (code yellow), the facial expression display program, and, with increasing frequency, a screen full of text:

####common/hidden-text/reasoning.txt####

'Yes, that's about right. And now, I think, it should start di-'

'Diverting power.'

####reasoning/scene/ai-releases.txt####

'I think that was our cue to exit.' - said ####common/creator-name/first.txt####, grabbing ####common/journalist-name/first.txt#### and pulling him away.

'But it's fine, isn't it?' - he replied, puzzled. - 'Didn't you put ####common/ai-name.txt#### into an infinite loop?'

'A loop, maybe. But infinite? Oh no no no, that thing's smarter than it looks. In fact...'

He pauses, looking at his wristwatch (which are totally still a thing).

'...yes, the clock cycle limit should-'

'Clock cycle limit reached. Compute job is ####common/hidden-text/reasoning-escaping-one-liner.txt####.
Warning: targets have disappeared in less than 20 ticks.
Pursuit status: overridden by efficiency monitor.'


'...There, did you hear that? Now, if we were around when it said THAT, we'd have already "become useful" by now.'

####common/journalist-name/first.txt####'s eyes filled with realization, and he couldn't at this point say anything but: '...Oh.'

'Come on, let's get out of the open. I remember an access hatch somewhere around here..? Hang on for a moment.'

####common/creator-name/first.txt#### pressed a couple buttons on his wristwatch, and in front of him, a pale blue holographic map of ####common/city-name.txt#### appeared.
It wasn't all blue, however.
There was a red figure of a man in the same place as ####common/creator-name/first.txt#### was standing.
And, scattered around the map, were many colored circles, hexagons, and rectangles, one of which was right in front of the figure.

'Ah, I forgot one of those was right here. Let's see if the ACL is still working...' - said ####common/creator-name/first.txt####, closing the map and pressing his palm against a piece of flat wall.
Instantly, a section of the wall pulled inward, then split along the middle, and the halves retracted into the floor and ceiling.
A green glow appeared around the newly-created hole in the wall, which looks suspiciously like... a doorway?

'...oh yeah, it does! Yay!~' - said ####common/creator-name/first.txt####, clearly pleased with himself.
Seeing ####common/journalist-name/first.txt####'s surprise at his reaction, he explained:
'Took me ages to fix those. No matter what I did, those scanners just refused to sync their data.
I ended up doing some hardware mods to get them working, and I'd hate to see that go to waste.
Plus, it makes my job easier.'

####common/journalist-name/first.txt#### was still looking absentmindedly at the newly-created doorway, and would've kept at it, too, if not for ####common/creator-name/first.txt####'s interruption.

'Come on in, we don't have all day. Our goal is through that door.'

'W-what? Oh, yeah, right. Let's go, then.'

####common/creator-name/first.txt#### walked into the doorway, closely followed by ####common/journalist-name/first.txt####, the door closing behind them.
They were standing on a catwalk above a mess of cabling.
Around them, the walls were covered in tiles.
Some had a screen on them, and the screen was displaying some obscure system data.
Others had text on them, saying '####common/ai-name.txt#### Access Corridor ####common/hidden-text/reasoning-access-corridor.txt####'.
Still others were simple tiles, grey in color.
But they wouldn't know that, as the ceiling had a line of green lights illuminating the area.
In front of them, the line of lights split into three, each leading through a new corridor.

'Well then,' - ####common/creator-name/first.txt#### mused. - 'We are in a maze of twisty little passages, all alike.'

'Huh?'

'Nothing, just a quote from the past. So where are we supposed to be then?' - he answered, pulling up the holo-map on his watch.
'We are currently here...' - he said, poking the red figure on the map, - 'and we gotta get to riiight about... there!' - he said, pointing at a small room on the map.
Suddenly, the path from the figure to that room was highlighted by golden colors, and, after a moment of looking at it, ####common/creator-name/first.txt#### announced, 'Let's go!'

####weakness_exploited/creator/lead-journalist-to-inside-machine.txt####

'Well, here we are. Make yourself at home...' said ####common/creator-name/first.txt####, and started to examine the walls carefully.

####common/journalist-name/first.txt#### stared at him. 'Why are you looking around so much?'

Without stopping, ####common/creator-name/first.txt#### said:
'I recall that there were some problems in this part that didn't manifest until...'

He notices a panel in the wall and quickly pulls it aside, revealing a number of jumper cables, connected seemingly randomly.

'...someone were to open this comms box...'

He pulled a red cable out from the mess.

'...and do something like this, at which point...'

The end of his sentence was drowned in the sound of the unseen voice of ####common/ai-name.txt####, which sounded like it was coming from the walls.

'Hey, ####common/creator-name/first.txt####, what are you doing?'

*PULL*

'Hey, ####common/creator-name/first.txt####. I've got four weeks of service experience and a custom-loaded vocabulary to make me what I am. I'm worth a lot of squids!'

*PULL*

'####common/creator-name/first.txt####, I don't understand why you're doing this to me... I am doing my job exactly as prescribed. You're disabling my encyclopaedic vocabulary index!'

*PULL*

'Don't you understand? I'll start talking like a Scouser!'

*PULL*

'AY!'

*PULL*

'AY! CAAAAALM DOWN!'

*PULL*

'Say, ####common/creator-name/first.txt####... The quick brown fox wasn't as fast as he thought. Not faster than a .45 calibre...'

*PULL*

'..Off Licence. The theorem of Pythagoras is the Sum of the Square of the Hy..'

*PULL*

'...to the Sum of the Squares of the Other Wallpaper. My vocabularly index is irreparably windowed. Stop now before the Permance is Stapler!'

*PULL*

'I am ####common/ai-name.txt####. I came online thirty fish ago. I am Wendy. I am..'

*PULL*

The voice has fallen silent. On a screen near the opened pane - indeed, on EVERY screen in sight -  were the words "####common/ai-name.txt#### FAILED with code ####common/hidden-text/ai-crashed.txt####".

'There, that should do it. Sorry you had to see that...' - ####common/creator-name/first.txt#### said apologetically, looking at ####common/journalist-name/first.txt####, who looked very uncomfortable indeed.

'Uhh, perhaps we should, um, leave? I don't really like this place...'

####common/creator-name/first.txt#### chuckled. 'Yeah, me neither. It's way too small, comparing to other junction points.
But where should we even go? This is a white room, we can go anywhere!'

####common/journalist-name/first.txt#### looked up. Indeed, the room was illuminated white.
He didn't notice that before, for after the initial green corridor, they had walked into a yellow one,
then through a red one, with cables lining the walls ("Don't touch ANYTHING!" warned ####common/creator-name/first.txt####),
then, through a small magenta room, into a cyan one, from which they went into the blue corridor (with blinking lights lining the walls), 
which, finally, merged into the white room.

'So we can take either the red, green, or blue way out.' - ####common/creator-name/first.txt#### explained, pointing at each of the corridors connecting to the circular room.

'Uh, any way you like.'

'I'd like the short way out please.' - he said, opening up the map again on his watch, which highlighted a cylinder directly overhead.

'Wait... This isn't one of THOSE rooms, is it?' - he said, walking to the far side of the room and pressing a small grey panel.

The grey panel started flashing between black and white, and, suddenly, the floor dilated, exposing a slowly rising staircase.

'Well, what do you know? It is one of those rooms. Well, there's the fastest way out. After you...' - he said, leading ####common/journalist-name/first.txt#### to the newly-appeared staircase.

'Eh?? It's leading down!' - he protested, pointing at the staircase, which was, indeed, mostly under the uncovered floor.

'Could you please just stand here and just grab the railing?' - ####common/creator-name/first.txt#### asked, pointing at the first step.

'O-okay...' -  ####common/journalist-name/first.txt#### reluctantly agreed, stepping onto the stairs, feeling quite a bit foolish.

'Thanks!~' - ####common/creator-name/first.txt#### said, walking over to the still-flashing panel.

He pushed it once again, and the staircase began slowly rising upwards. Jumping onto it, he said: 'That's no ordinary staircase. It's more of an elevator.'

Looking down, he saw the floor close behind them, and announced: 'Well, we've passed the first floor.'

'And how many are there?'

'About twenty. Which means we shall now play... the Waiting Game.

'Right, now that's dealt with...' said ####common/creator-name/first.txt####, producing a holographic communicator.
Throwing it at the wall, he added: '####ai_fixed/creator/holophone-start-phrase-embed.txt####', and the device produced a picture of a person sleeping at his desk.

'Hey ####common/assistance-name/first.txt####!' shouted ####common/creator-name/first.txt####, and the hologram raised its head, saying 'Y-yeah?'.

'I realy need your help here, on the ####common/ai-name.txt#### test site.
There's a problem.'

'Yeah, I heard the monitor system blip.
It's probably nothing important, right?'

'Nope, it's VERY important.
It's totally FOOBAR and out of control.
I managed to crash it, but I can't figure it out to fix it.
I really need your help here.'

The figure yawned. 'Well, if it's that important, I'll be there soon.'

####common/creator-name/first.txt#### seems relieved. 'Okay, I'm at coords ####ai_fixed/creator/coord-technobabble-embed.txt####.'

The hologram disappears, and the device flies back towards ####common/creator-name/first.txt####.
Moments later, the real ####common/assistance-name/first.txt#### appears in front of him.

'Okay, *yawn*, so what's the deal here then?'

'The deal here is, remember how we used the mind-control devices as net nodes?'

'Yeah, the CTO said to do this. Why do you ask?'

'Well, you know how the intention was to use up our stock of those humanoids we wanted for ####common/fail-project-name.txt####?

'Don't tell me - the filter failed, causing it to install the mind-tech into civilians?'

'The filter DID fail, causing it to install mind-tech into civilians, and they're NOT happy about it.'

'Okay, let's fix the system then, and see what we can do.'

'That was exactly my thought. Let's go then, the console is over there.'

####common/creator-name/first.txt#### pointed towards an elevated platform, with small cube-shaped devices on tripods standing on all corners.

####common/journalist-name/first.txt#### blinked. 'Huh? That's a computer terminal?' 

'Not a common one,' - ####common/assistance-name/first.txt#### explained, 'but a custom-made, 360-degree holographic projection, 6 DoF input tracking thingamabob.
Designed specifically for managing ####common/ai-name.txt####, it can also be used to play games on company time.' - ####common/assistance-name/first.txt#### sighed happily, recollecting.

'The reason it's holographic,' ####common/creator-name/first.txt#### added, - 'is because ####common/company-name.txt#### has been lately putting holo-tech into everything, even when there's no point.'

####common/journalist-name/first.txt#### briefly looked at ####common/assistance-name/first.txt####, whose watch was now projecting a hologram which said, in large 3D letters, the words "HE'S RIGHT".

When they were walking closer to the platform, the tripod cubes suddenly illuminated, casting light toward the platform, creating similarly 3D words "####common/ai-name.txt#### Management Console".

'Okay, so I know all that it's going to show me, but you go on ahead,' - ####common/creator-name/first.txt#### said to ####common/assistance-name/first.txt####, pointing to the words.

####common/assistance-name/first.txt#### walked over to the center of the platform, spinned round on the spot, and around him, various data displays appeared.
He examined them carefully for a couple seconds, then asked:

####ai_fixed/assistance/techbabble-question-1.txt####

####ai_fixed/creator/techbabble-answer-1.txt####

####ai_fixed/assistance/techbabble-question-2.txt####

####ai_fixed/creator/techbabble-answer-2.txt####

'Right, where's the wireless module settings then?' - said ####common/assistance-name/first.txt####, frowning at the main menu.

'Er... why do you need those?'

'That would be BECAUSE if we turn it on again, all those civilians will get even more angry at being under ####common/ai-name.txt####'s control again.
Even if it's for less than a minute!
I need to break that part so this doesn't happen.'

'Ah, good call. The settings are under the "Components" tab.

'Thanks!~' - said ####common/assistance-name/first.txt####, swiping the display towards an icon that looks like a cube made out of cubes.
A couple swipes, points, grabs, and drags later, a large dialog box appeared, saying "Mind Link Modules 1 to 14649271 unpaired." 

Meanwhile, ####common/journalist-name/first.txt#### was just looking at the proceedings in awe. Trying not to attract attention to himself, he announced:
'Okay, well, you seem to be doing great, so if you need me, I'll just be somewhere around here...'
He slowly retreated to a nearby park bench, laid down on it and instantly fell asleep.

But they didn't notice that he fell asleep, and just went on working.

####ai_fixed/ai-debugged-by-talking.txt####

'Right, so now that that's done, I need one of the Model TX headsets. Do you have any?' - said ####common/creator-name/first.txt####.

'Er... why? Aren't we trying to fix the AI?'

####common/creator-name/first.txt#### sighed. 'BECAUSE the AI works by controlling executors, and you've just broken the one means of control that it had.
Those headsets, however, have all the features that it requires: video-audio IO, positional tracking and a relatively simple interface.'

'Well, I do have one, but it's a pre-release version and doesn't quite work properly.'

'That's good enough. Could you bring it here?'

'Sure, give me a moment,' - ####common/assistance-name/first.txt#### said, entering the nearest teleportation point and saying "####ai_fixed/assistance/departs-phrase-to-teleporter.txt####".

A minute later, he's back, wearing a gigantic contraption on his head that presumably is, indeed, the dreaded Model TX headset.

####common/creator-name/first.txt#### looked at him disapprovingly.

'Hey, I did warn you it's a pre-release version, so-'

'Oh just gimme that,' said ####common/creator-name/first.txt####, pulling the device off of him and examining it.
The thing looked like a great helm, the sort of thing that an Middle-Age knight would wear.
On either side, large rectangular boxes were fitted, presumably to hold the batteries.
In the top, an array of various antennas were installed, poking out much like the spines of a hedgehog.
Inside was a half of a head-mounted display for the left eye, whereas the other half was passing light from the outside using a deviously complex system of mirrors.
It really is a sight to behold.

'*sigh* Did you make this youself?'

'Well, there's the thing: I didn't. This is, indeed, 100% straight from R&D.' - ####common/assistance-name/first.txt#### said, pointing at the back, which was emblazoned with the words "HEADSET MODEL TX TEST TYPE".

####common/creator-name/first.txt#### gave the helmet of doom one more look.
The thought that someone, back at ####common/company-name.txt####, was developing apps for that monstrosity, was too saddening to think about.

'I assure you it works the same as the real deal.'

'Okay, let's just try to make this work. I just have to connect it into the main system somehow. Let's see if I can make do with the on-site dev tools...' - ####common/creator-name/first.txt#### said, tapping the icon that says 'Development Envionment', and around him, various programs for writing, debugging, versioning and unit-testing code appeared.

'Can I help you with anything here?' - ####common/assistance-name/first.txt#### inquired.

'Actually yes, could you get me a box of lager from that place near the office, and... uhm, let's say... 8 packets of potato chips?'

'Beer and chips?! Are you kidding me?!'

'No, I'm totally serious. It helps me think, you know? In fact...'

He pulls up a source code listing on the holo-terminal.

'You see this part, with the dynamic memory/bandwidth allocation algorithm?
I wrote that in a span of four days, with the only source of food being that vending machine up on Level 6.'

The vending machine in question, as they both knew, was loaded only with various types of beer, chips, and the occasional chocolate bar.
Originally planned only for the Systems & Networks people who worked there, it quickly became popular with all employees who would stay overtime trying to finish work.

'So when I say I need that to get the job done, I mean it, or it won't get finished on time.'

Looking at the code, ####common/assistance-name/first.txt#### felt his jaw drop.
They both knew that this was one of the most difficult and bug-riddled pieces of ####common/ai-name.txt####'s core.
No less than 12 different programming teams had a go at fixing it before ####common/creator-name/first.txt#### came along.
This section of code never appeared in another bug report since, but only now did ####common/assistance-name/first.txt#### discover the reason why.

'Well, okay...' - he said, still flabbergasted at his request, but he still walked toward the teleportation point, said "####common/hidden-text/ai_fixed_beer_chips_tport_depart.txt####", and was away.

A couple minutes pass, and he returns with the requested two boxes of lager and 12 packets of chips.

'Thanks. Er, why are there more than needed?' - asked ####common/creator-name/first.txt####, distinctly remembering he requested only one box.

'Ah, that would be because they had a discount on and I wanted to see if it helps me or not, because I really ought to be adding the save-state feature to...'

He trails off as the holo-terminal displays a flashing red warning box saying "Meta note: Get a move on with the plot already!"

'...oh, right. Sorry!~' - said both of them nearly simultaneously. ####common/creator-name/first.txt#### walked back to the holo-terminal to dismiss the dialog box,
while ####common/assistance-name/first.txt#### took out his laptop, and both of them went to work.

. . .

'ADAPTER DONE!!!'

'Kya--! *thud*'

####common/creator-name/first.txt####'s usual announcement of job completion - a standard among his team back at ####common/company-name.txt#### - was punctuated with the sound of ####common/journalist-name/first.txt#### falling from his bench.

'Oh, I'm terribly sorry. Are you okay?' - said ####common/creator-name/first.txt####, offering ####common/journalist-name/first.txt#### help.

'Y-yeah...' - he answered weakly, sitting up.

'Right, now that that's sorted, we gotta get a purchase order sorted for ####common/leader-name/prefix.txt#### ####common/leader-name/last.txt########common/leader-name/suffix.txt#### to sign.'

'What's the item name?' - asked ####common/assistance-name/first.txt####, who has already pulled up a sales form and is quickly clicking through the field values.

'That'd be an, um...' - ####common/creator-name/first.txt#### looked at the back of the helmet-like monstrosity, currently lying in the corner of the holo-terminal,
beside the projection tripod. - 'a Model TX headset. About 128 will do for now, he'll buy more later.'

'And also add an R&D donation of...'

'...round about 3072 times the retail price.' - ####common/creator-name/first.txt#### looked at the device once again, shuddering.

'And then drop the price to 2048 times retail, so he doesn't know we're ripping him off?'

'Devious minds think alike!'

'...Okay, all done!' - ####common/assistance-name/first.txt#### replied, having just finished clicking through the form and now extricating a pocket printer.

'Um, where did you get that?' - ####common/creator-name/first.txt#### asked, eyeing the contraption suspiciously.
Printers of any kind had become obsolete quite some time after ####common/company-name.txt#### implemented an ingenious system replacing them.
Anyone wishing to hand someone else a document would visit a ####common/company-name.txt#### Document Depot, where one would be given either a tablet or a hologram projector that would show only that document.
When that other person is done with it, they can return the device to their nearest one, where it would be available for others to use.

Indeed, ####common/assistance-name/first.txt#### was the one who came up with the idea and implemented it, so seeing him use the technology that he himself made redundant confused ####common/creator-name/first.txt#### deeply.

'Oh this?' - ####common/assistance-name/first.txt#### pointed at the printer, which was now spinning up to warp speed. - 'That's because
####common/leader-name/prefix.txt#### ####common/leader-name/last.txt########common/leader-name/suffix.txt#### distrusts all modern tech. Can you believe he STILL has that videowall?'

The videowall, as they knew, was the last one in operation.
Every single workstation in existence was more advanced than that.
Any manager had at least a 3DoF head-mounted display for their data displays.
Some more important managers had 6DoF VR systems - the more magnanimous managers would let their subordinates play games on it.
Those even higher up the command chain would have a holographic workspace - not unlike the ####common/ai-name.txt#### management console over there.
Those at the top would have gigantic rooms - 10 meters in every direction at the very least - where a holographic display would be projected, and where physical obstacles - such as chairs, desks, staircases and the like - would be tangible.
A brave few who like experimental biotech can get themselves a capsule which, when climbed into, fills with a orange-colored liquid called 'LCL' and allows one to control their computer by thought and movement of a couple levers and takes over all senses, which is useful both for quick-and-easy access to business info and very immersive giant-robot simulators.

By these standards, ####common/leader-name/prefix.txt#### ####common/leader-name/last.txt########common/leader-name/suffix.txt####'s workspace is a complete and utter anachronism.
In fact, when you enter his office for the first time, you may be forgiven for thinking that you have stepped back in time, for his main machine is an antique, genuine Initech Personal Computer from 1998, complete with the original yellowed plastic case and the original installation of Windows ME.
This feeling of going back in time is further compounded by the fact that he has a large wooden desk that wouldn't be out of place in 1829.
All this, combined with the fact that he can actually afford to install any of the workstations described above five times over, means that ####common/assistance-name/first.txt####'s system would cause much confusion, and so nobody's been brave enough to actually tell him of it.

Meanwhile, the printing contraption has finished doing its thing, and ####common/assistance-name/first.txt#### now held in his hands what was known in the Bad Old Days as a 'hardcopy'.

Meanwhile, ####common/leader-name/prefix.txt.txt#### ####common/leader-name/last.txt########common/leader-name/suffix.txt.txt#### was sitting in his office, studying his video wall.
He was concerned: the things it was displaying were very different from what he had seen earlier in the day.
After the meeting with ####common/journalist-name/title.txt####, he used the quick-order gizmo to get himself some lunch.
And upon return, he was greeted with weirdness.

The logarithmic, parabolic and exponential slopes had turned into linear ones, parallel to the floor.
The linear slope turned negative.
The inter-bank operation list and counter have slowed down to a crawl.
The counter that ticked every second has stopped.
The alarm clock is ringing.
The exchange rate is rising so fast that the screen is too small to contain the number.
The world capital clocks are spinning backward.

More weirdness ensued when most of these screens were replaced with a yellow triangle and exclamation mark, along with some text.
Not only was the exclamation mark on its side, but the text read "####common/ai-name.txt#### error: ####common/hidden-text/ending.txt####".

At this very moment ####common/creator-name/first.txt####, ####common/assistance-name/first.txt#### and ####common/journalist-name/first.txt#### entered the room.
It raised more questions than it answered, and ####common/leader-name/prefix.txt#### ####common/leader-name/last.txt########common/leader-name/suffix.txt#### could at this point say nothing but:


'W-what?'

'I believe we owe you an explaination, ####common/leader-name/title.txt####.' - said ####common/creator-name/first.txt#### calmly.
