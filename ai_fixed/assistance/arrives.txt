'Hey {common/assistance-name/first}!' shouted {common/creator-name/first}, and the hologram raised its head, saying 'Y-yeah?'.

'I really need your help here, on the {common/ai-name} test site.
There's a problem.'

'Yeah, I heard the monitor system blip.
It's probably nothing important, right?'

'Nope, it's VERY important.
It's totally FOOBAR and out of control.
I managed to crash it, but I can't figure it out to fix it.
I really need your help here.'

The figure yawned. 'Well, if it's that important, I'll be there soon.'

{common/creator-name/first} seems relieved. 'Okay, I'm at coords {ai_fixed/creator/coord-technobabble-embed}.'

The hologram disappears, and the device flies back towards {common/creator-name/first}.
Moments later, the real {common/assistance-name/first} appears in front of him.
