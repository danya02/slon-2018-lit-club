'Built upon the latest Roswell CPU technology, the main processor box is custom-built for the task of managing high-performance industrial environments.
It can be expanded infinitely simply by connecting more of these addon modules. The GPU modules expand its ability to manage movement of its execution actors, or "nodes".
The memory banks are used for storing info on the best method of execution of some particular task.
The wireless modules are used for connecting to the execution nodes.
On the task level, it can do up to 64 parallel tasks in the basic package, which is what you see here.
All tasks are switchable between individual nodes, support adding and removing nodes from a task without halting execution.
It can also mirror tasks, for those cases when a task can be done repeatedly on some predictable objects.
Finally, it has automatic danger avoidance built in, but in case that doesn't help, it has error correction.'

He paused momentarily, then added: 'One of the most important under-the-hood features in data handling is the GZIP COMPRESSION for all data
streams at the hardware level, reducing the control signal transfer overhead and optimizing the in-memory storage.
The GZIP COMPRESSION chips are also available for purchase from the {common/company-name} parts store.'
