'Right, where's the wireless module settings then?' - said {common/assistance-name/first}, frowning at the main menu.

'Er... why do you need those?'

'That would be BECAUSE if we turn it on again, all those civilians will get even more angry at being under {common/ai-name}'s control again.

I need to break that part so this doesn't happen.'

'Ah, good call. The settings are under the "Components" tab.

'Thanks!~' - said {common/assistance-name/first}, swiping the display towards an icon that looks like a cube made out of cubes.
A couple swipes, points, grabs, and drags later, a large dialog box appeared, saying "Mind Link Modules 1 to 14649271 unpaired."
