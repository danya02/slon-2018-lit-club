Misunderstanding causes suffering to parties; that is resolved when parties manage to communicate clearly.

Tentative plot outline:

cute creatures look like in danger;
humans capture them and bring them to home;
creatures keep being cute and start breeding;
humanity crowded out;
creatures learn human speech, explain they were never in danger, they are exhausted by being cute, they want to return;
humans go "My God, What Have I Done?";
humans return creatures to seeming danger;
creatures happy at being there.


Setting prerequisites:

world different from ours;
simple transport to/from said world;
creatures undiscovered and uncontacted until now
