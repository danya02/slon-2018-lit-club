And so, ####common/ai_name.txt#### was given a small area of the city of ####common/city_name.txt####.
The AI ####ai_expands/ai/phrases/verbed-worked.txt####, and soon, the area had become completely ####ai_expands/ai/phrases/verbed-goal.txt####.
####ai_expands/ai/requested-to-expand-first-time-single-line.txt####


Soon, the AI realised that producing the ####common/humanoids-genitive.txt#### is not efficient enough.
So it had written up a proposal for the ####common/leader-title-3rd-person.txt#### of ####common/city_name.txt####, ####common/leader-name/prefix.txt#### ####common/leader-name/first.txt#### ####common/leader-name/last.txt########common/leader-name/suffix.txt####.
The proposal was to stop producing new ####common/humanoids-genitive.txt####, and to use the existing technology to control people instead.
####ai_expands/leader-was-distracted-so-signed-proposal.txt####



####ai_expands/ai-world-describe.txt####

Meanwhile, ####common/leader-name/prefix.txt#### ####common/leader-name/last.txt########common/leader-name/suffix.txt#### was sitting in his office, admiring his video wall.
The video wall, the last operational one in the world, was charting the economic values of ####common/city_name.txt#### in real time.
For the last 50 years, nobody -- himself included -- could ever do anything to make them increase.
However, with the introduction of ####common/ai_name.txt####, they began rising in hours.
It was all so unexpected that ####common/leader-name/prefix.txt#### ####common/leader-name/last.txt########common/leader-name/suffix.txt#### was trying very hard to take it all in.

Logarithmic slope.
A counter that ticks every second.
Linear slope.
A set of clocks for the world capitals.
A list of all inter-bank operations.
A counter that ticks every time an inter-bank operation occurs.
Parabolic slope.
An alarm clock.
Exchange rates between major currencies.
A quick-order menu for a restauraunt near the building.
A counter that ticks forty times it ticks every second time.
Exponential slope.
A list of appointments.
A counter has been counting down for the last 5 minutes and is now saying 5, 4, 3, 2, 1...



The door opened, and ####ai_expands/journalist/first-look-desc-embed.txt#### walked into the office.

####ai_expands/leader/tells-journalist-no-i-dont-cut-off.txt####


His words are interrupted by the sound of a video-phone, also a thing of the past, and he answers it. A screen in the video-wall is replaced by the words "SOUND ONLY".


'####common/ai_name.txt#### to ####common/leader-name/prefix.txt#### ####common/leader-name/first.txt#### ####common-leader-name/last.txt########common/leader-name/suffix.txt####, videophone link.
Requesting permission to convert ####ai_expands/ai/area_name.txt####.'


'Yeah, sure, whatever.
As long as the economy improves.'


'Acknowledged. Thank you for your cooperation.' the voice reverberates, as the screen returns to displaying the alarm clock.

####ai_expands/leader/responds-can-decline-at-any-time.txt####

####ai_expands/journalist/starts-to-protest.txt####

The room is filled with the sound of a bell as the appointment list gizmo blinks and shows the next item, which turns out to be 'Lunch'.
The time-until-next-appointment counter has reset to 600 and started to count down.

####reasoning/arriving-into-city.txt####

####reasoning/normal-talks.txt####

####common/creator-name/first.txt#### muttered under his breath:
'I had hoped it wouldn't come to this...'


He sighs, then faces the machine, speaking loud and clear:

'####common/ai-name.txt####, before you proceed, I would like to say: ####reasoning/creator/logic-puzzle.txt####.'


The AI pauses for a moment. '####reasoning/ai/logic-puzzle-answer-trailing-off.txt####
Error: This statement is self-contradictory. Does not-not-not-n-not compute.'


####common/creator-name/first.txt#### looked at the screen intently.
The screen was rapidly changing its contents.
Every few seconds, the screen would flip between memory dumps, data displays, system status monitors (code yellow), the facial expression display program, and, with increasing frequency, a screen full of text:

####common/hidden-text/reasoning.txt####

'Yes, that's about right. And now, I think, it should start di-'

'Diverting power.'

####reasoning/scene/ai-releases.txt####


'I think that was our cue to exit.' - said ####common/creator-name/first.txt####, grabbing ####common/journalist-name/first.txt#### and pulling him away.


'But it's fine, isn't it?' - he replied, puzzled. - 'Didn't you put ####common/ai-name.txt#### into an infinite loop?'

'A loop, maybe. But infinite? Oh no no no, that thing's smarter than it looks. In fact...'

He pauses, looking at his wristwatch (which are totally still a thing).

'...yes, the clock cycle limit should-'


'Clock cycle limit reached. Compute job is ####common/hidden-text/reasoning-escaping-one-liner.txt####.
Warning: targets have disappeared in less than 20 ticks.
Pursuit status: overridden by efficiency monitor.'





'...There, did you hear that? Now, if we were around when it said THAT, we'd have already "become useful" by now.'

####common/journalist-name/first.txt####'s eyes filled with realization, and he couldn't at this point say anything but: '...Oh.'

'Come on, let's get out of the open. I remember an access hatch somewhere around here..? Hang on for a moment.'

####common/creator-name/first.txt#### pressed a couple buttons on his wristwatch, and in front of him, a pale blue holographic map of ####common/city-name.txt#### appeared.
It wasn't all blue, however.
There was a red figure of a man in the same place as ####common/creator-name/first.txt#### was standing.
And, scattered around the map, were many colored circles, hexagons, and rectangles, one of which was right in front of the figure.

'Ah, I forgot one of those was right here. Let's see if the ACL is still working...' - said ####common/creator-name/first.txt####, closing the map and pressing his palm against a piece of flat wall.
Instantly, a section of the wall pulled inward, then split along the middle, and the halves retracted into the floor and ceiling.
A green glow appeared around the newly-created hole in the wall, which looks suspiciously like... a doorway?

'...oh yeah, it does! Yay!~' - said ####common/creator-name/first.txt####, clearly pleased with himself.
Seeing ####common/journalist-name/first.txt####'s surprise at his reaction, he explained:
'Took me ages to fix those. No matter what I did, those scanners just refused to sync their data.
I ended up doing some hardware mods to get them working, and I'd hate to see that go to waste.
Plus, it makes my job easier.'

####common/journalist-name/first.txt#### was still looking absentmindedly at the newly-created doorway, and would've kept at it, too, if not for ####common/creator-name/first.txt####'s interruption.

'Come on in, we don't have all day. Our goal is through that door.'

'W-what? Oh, yeah, right. Let's go, then.'

####common/creator-name/first.txt#### walked into the doorway, closely followed by ####common/journalist-name/first.txt####, the door closing behind them.
They were standing on a catwalk above a mess of cabling.
Around them, the walls were covered in tiles.
Some had a screen on them, and the screen was displaying some obscure system data.
Others had text on them, saying '####common/ai-name.txt#### Access Corridor ####common/hidden-text/reasoning-access-corridor.txt####'.
Still others were simple tiles, grey in color.
But they wouldn't know that, as the ceiling had a line of green lights illuminating the area.

####weakness_exploited/creator/lead...####



'Well, here we are. Make yourself at home...' said ####common/creator-name/first.txt####, and started to examine the walls carefully.


####common/journalist-name/first.txt#### stared at him. 'Why are you looking around so much?'


Without stopping, ####common/creator-name/first.txt#### said:
'I recall that there were some problems in this part that didn't manifest until...'


He notices a panel in the wall and quickly pulls it aside, revealing a number of jumper cables, connected seemingly randomly.

'...someone were to open this comms box...'


He pulled a red cable out from the mess.

'...and do something like this, at which point...'

'Right, now that's dealt with...' said ####common/creator-name/first.txt####, producing a holographic communicator.
Throwing it at the wall, he added: '####ai_fixed/creator/holophone-start-phrase-embed.txt####', and the device produced a picture of a person sleeping at his desk.


'Hey ####common/assistance-name/first.txt####!' shouted ####common/creator-name/first.txt####, and the hologram raised its head, saying 'Y-yeah?'.

'I realy need your help here, on the ####common/ai-name.txt#### test site.
There's a problem.'

'Yeah, I heard the monitor system blip.
It's probably nothing important, right?'

'Nope, it's VERY important.
It's totally FOOBAR and out of control.
I managed to crash it, but I can't figure it out to fix it.
I really need your help here.'

The figure yawned. 'Well, if it's that important, I'll be there soon.'

####common/creator-name/first.txt#### seems relieved. 'Okay, I'm at coords ####ai_fixed/creator/coord-technobabble-embed.txt####.'

The hologram disappears, and the device flies back towards ####common/creator-name/first.txt####.
Moments later, the real ####common/assistance-name/first.txt#### appears in front of him.

####ai_fixed/creator/lets-go-to-leader.txt####



Meanwhile, ####common/leader-name/prefix.txt.txt#### ####common/leader-name/last.txt########common/leader-name/suffix.txt.txt#### was sitting in his office, studying his video wall.
He was concerned: the things it was displaying were very different from what he had seen earlier in the day.
After the meeting with ####common/journalist-name/title.txt####, he used the quick-order gizmo to get himself some lunch.
And upon return, he was greeted with weirdness.

The logarithmic, parabolic and exponential slopes had turned into linear ones, parallel to the floor.
The linear slope turned negative.
The inter-bank operation list and counter have slowed down to a crawl.
The counter that ticked every second has stopped.
The alarm clock is ringing.
The exchange rate is rising so fast that the screen is too small to contain the number.
The world capital clocks are spinning backward.

More weirdness ensued when most of these screens were replaced with a yellow triangle and exclamation mark, along with some text.
Not only was the exclamation mark on its side, but the text read "####common/ai-name.txt#### error: ####common/hidden-text/ending.txt####".

At this very moment ####common/creator-name/first.txt####, ####common/assistance-name/first.txt#### and ####common/journalist-name/first.txt#### entered the room.
It raised more questions than it answered, and ####common/leader-name/prefix.txt#### ####common/leader-name/last.txt########common/leader-name/suffix.txt#### could at this point say nothing but:



'W-what?'



'I believe we owe you an explaination, ####common/leader-name/title.txt####.' - said ####common/creator-name/first.txt#### calmly.
