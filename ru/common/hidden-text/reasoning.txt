!So I just wanted this to be some sort of usual Logic Bomb-type scenario, with the paradox confusing the hell out of the AI and the oppressed people leaving. However, if I did that the usual way, there would be the problem that such a complex system can be defeated by a single statement. So it gets better, but not quick enough.

The reason that they didn't stick around is because I have no idea on how to proceed. If they are captured by the zomboids, it has already been established that they are forced to work for the AI, and if I made the story about how the surviving member gets the other one released, then the story would be much longer than this, and already it's th longest one there was where I wrote this. And if I had made some sort of dramatic fight scene involving the party and the zombiods, then you would feel bad for the zomboids, as they are the civilians, and also the whole scene would suck, as I'm no good at descriptive writing (you may have guessed that already).

So with this sort of situation, what can I do to defeat the AI? Simple: let's go to the dungeon!

(I promise this makes sense, honest!)
