!The main point of this whole scene was to describe the creator in more depth. I'm not really a fan of character descriptions that just say how they look. I prefer it when you see the person's way of living, and how he talks. I mostly modeled the creator after myself, and his house is the sort of place I'd like to live in, making this a sort of wishful thinking.
