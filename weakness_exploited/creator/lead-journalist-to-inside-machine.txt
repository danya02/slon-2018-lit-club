'...There, did you hear that? Now, if we were around when it said THAT, we'd have already "become useful" by now.'

{common/journalist-name/first}'s eyes filled with realization, and he couldn't at this point say anything but: '...Oh.'

'Come on, let's get out of the open. I remember an access hatch somewhere around here..? Hang on for a moment.'

{common/creator-name/first} pressed a couple buttons on his wristwatch, and in front of him, a pale blue holographic map of {common/city-name} appeared.
It wasn't all blue, however.
There was a red figure of a man in the same place as {common/creator-name/first} was standing.
And, scattered around the map, were many colored circles, hexagons, and rectangles, one of which was right in front of the figure.

'Ah, I forgot one of those was right here. Let's see if the ACL is still working...' - said {common/creator-name/first}, closing the map and pressing his palm against a piece of flat wall.
Instantly, a section of the wall pulled inward, then split along the middle, and the halves retracted into the floor and ceiling.
A green glow appeared around the newly-created hole in the wall, which looks suspiciously like... a doorway?

'...oh yeah, it does! Yay!~' - said {common/creator-name/first}, clearly pleased with himself.
Seeing {common/journalist-name/first}'s surprise at his reaction, he explained:
'Took me ages to fix those. No matter what I did, those scanners just refused to sync their data.
I ended up doing some hardware mods to get them working, and I'd hate to see that go to waste.
Plus, it makes my job easier.'

{common/journalist-name/first} was still looking absentmindedly at the newly-created doorway, and would've kept at it, too, if not for {common/creator-name/first}'s interruption.

'Come on in, we don't have all day. Our goal is through that door.'

'W-what? Oh, yeah, right. Let's go, then.'

{common/creator-name/first} walked into the doorway, closely followed by {common/journalist-name/first}, the door closing behind them.
They were standing on a catwalk above a mess of cabling.
Around them, the walls were covered in tiles.
Some had a screen on them, and the screen was displaying some obscure system data.
Others had text on them, saying '{common/ai-name} Access Corridor {common/hidden-text/reasoning-access-corridor}'.
Still others were simple tiles, grey in color.
But they wouldn't know that, as the ceiling had a line of green lights illuminating the area.
