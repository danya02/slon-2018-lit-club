The city of {common/city-name} looked very futuristic indeed.
Every building had many blinking lights, presumably connected to {common/ai-name} in some way.
Autonomous cars, drones and small wheeled robots moved across the landscape.
In the center of the city, on a large platform, the compute core of {common/ai-name} was located.
It has grown significantly as compared to the demo version.

However, the center was empty.
All the people were at this point in time quite far away from there.
If an outsider would come there, they would notice an oddity:

Everyone was moving in perfect sync.

Since all was controlled by {common/ai-name}, so were the people.
Everyone was doing exactly what is most needed to maximise productivity.

Exactly at 06:55, every person left their home, and walked, in a straight line, merging with larger ones, toward their place of employment.
And exactly at 21:25, all would start walking back to their homes.

This is what an outsider would see.
But in truth, he will not see this.
Because {common/ai-name}'s goal is to maximise performance, and it is most easily achieved by large numbers, the outsider would be taken to the center.
At this point, it was irrelevant that he was an outsider, and any of his outside obligations did not matter.

He wasn't helping get the job done.

He had to be "made useful".

And this is the reason why the center was empty.
Anyone arriving there, for any length of time and for any reason, did not return.
And that is how the productivity of the city kept increasing.
