1. AI created, implemented to DO STUFF. Everything okay.
2. AI proceeds to improve small area and expands. Most happy, some worried.
3. AI takes over large area in which STUFF IS DONE. Humans therein are controlled by AI via biotech.
4. Sadness ensues. Description of how the world that is taken over is bad for people there.
5. Creators of the AI try and reason with it. Fails. Logical paradox invoked, fails. 
6. Creators find weakness in AI. Sequentially disable stuff, AI goes weird, then shuts down.
7. People reawaken, find world in this state, are surprised.
8. Creators fix AI to never use humans and limit area of influence, restart. System is successfully used in industry.
