'No, I'm totally serious. It helps me think, you know? In fact...'

He pulls up a source code listing on the holo-terminal.

'You see this part, with the dynamic memory/bandwidth allocation algorithm?
I wrote that in a span of four days, with the only source of food being that vending machine up on Level 6.'

The vending machine in question, as they both knew, was loaded only with various types of beer, chips, and the occasional chocolate bar.
Originally planned only for the Systems & Networks people who worked there, it quickly became popular with all employees who would stay overtime trying to finish work.

'So when I say I need that to get the job done, I mean it, or it won't get finished on time.'

Looking at the code, {common/assistance-name/first} felt his jaw drop.
They both knew that this was one of the most difficult and bug-riddled pieces of {common/ai-name}'s core.
No less than 12 different programming teams had a go at fixing it before {common/creator-name/first} came along.
This section of code never appeared in another bug report since, but only now did {common/assistance-name/first} discover the reason why.

'Well, okay...' - he said, still flabbergasted at his request, but he still walked toward the teleportation point, said "{common/hidden-text/ai_fixed_beer_chips_tport_depart}", and was away.

A couple minutes pass, and he returns with the requested two boxes of lager and 12 packets of chips.

'Thanks. Er, why are there more than needed?' - asked {common/creator-name/first}, distinctly remembering he requested only one box.

'Ah, that would be because they had a discount on and I wanted to see if it helps me or not, because I really ought to be adding the save-state feature to...'

He trails off as the holo-terminal displays a flashing red warning box saying "Meta note: Get a move on with the plot already!"

'...oh, right. Sorry!~' - said both of them nearly simultaneously. {common/creator-name/first} walked back to the holo-terminal to dismiss the dialog box,
while {common/assistance-name/first} took out his laptop, and both of them went to work.
