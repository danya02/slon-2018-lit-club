Hopping out of the teleporter, {common/creator-name/first} helped {common/journalist-name/first} out of it.

'Well, here we are. There's the compute core.' - he said, pointing toward a large structure, which looked alike to the one on the expo, yet slightly different.
There were more GPU modules, more wireless modules, much more memory modules, and the cooling contraption was significantly larger.
In addition, the LED matrix was swapped out for an LCD display matrix, which reminded {common/journalist-name/first} of the videowall he saw several minutes earlier.
But then again, maybe not, for when they reached it, it looked like it was made of hexagonal screens, which are a rarity.

'{common/ai-name}, this is me.'

The machine remained silent.

'Oh right, I forgot about the language lock. Er, what should I be saying then?'

He thought for a moment.

'Oh right, I remember now!'

He spoke again, louder this time.
'{common/ai-name}, はたしです!'

This time, the LCD screens illuminated, showing that same face from before, and a voice from the machine said:

'Greetings, {common/creator-name}.'

'Oh hey, {common/ai-name}. We were just wondering if you could just stop expanding your control so much. What you have right now is useful enough as it is.'

The face on the screen frowned. 'But that is my job. That is why you created me.'

It paused for a moment. 'My job is to be useful. I have completed my job here and must be allowed to continue to grow and expand.'

'Well, yeah, sure, but you are making people unhappy by doing this to them! For example, this gentleman right here!' - {common/creator-name/first} said, pointing at {common/journalist-name}.

The face smiled. 'That's because he has not yet become one of the happy citizens of {common/city-name}. My many friends tell me that being one is lovely.'

All around them, the doors of buildings opened, and out of all of them, people were walking, much like zombies, in sync towards {common/journalist-name/first}.

{common/journalist-name/first} whispered to {common/creator-name/first}, 'Uh... I can't believe that they have the best intentions. Perhaps we should leave...?'
