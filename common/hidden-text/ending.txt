!The videowall is acting this strangely because it is currently in a mode that depends on the AI. Since it was broken and then fixed, everything is weird.

The actual list of gizmos on the videowall, as presented near the beginning, was given as a lot of sentence fragments. This is because, while writing this, I was playing Doki Doki Literature Club!, which is a visual novel whereby some girls write poems. I was inspired by the style in which one of them was written, specifically: http://ddlcwiki.ga/wiki/Wheel.

Also from that game, I got the actual idea of using base64 to encode data, for example in yuri.chr, a copy of which I uploaded here: https://a.coka.la/He9nh9.chr Much like this tet, it's some meaning hidden inside something else. But here, I've had to use gzip too, to make the size easily manageable.

Oh, and also, this is the last of these texts, so I guess this is where we part. So as a final note, since you stuck with me reading all of this, I'm leaving you a link to the GitHub page where this was written: https://github.com/danya02/slon-2018-lit-club And if you want to just send me a message, my email address is (my GitHub username without numbers)@(my GitHub username).ru

Thanks for reading, and goodbye!
