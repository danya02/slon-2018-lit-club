The voice has fallen silent. On a screen near the opened pane - indeed, on EVERY screen in sight -  were the words "{common/ai-name} FAILED with code {common/hidden-text/ai-crashed}".

'There, that should do it. Sorry you had to see that...' - {common/creator-name/first} said apologetically, looking at {common/journalist-name/first}, who looked very uncomfortable indeed.

'Uhh, perhaps we should, um, leave? I don't really like this place...'

{common/creator-name/first} chuckled. 'Yeah, me neither. It's way too small, comparing to other junction points.
But where should we even go? This is a white room, we can go anywhere!'

{common/journalist-name/first} looked up. Indeed, the room was illuminated white.
He didn't notice that before, for after the initial green corridor, they had walked into a yellow one,
then through a red one, with many cables on the walls jumping between junction boxes and power monitors on each,
then walked through a small magenta room, which was mostly occupied  by a large metal box with cables all around it, all loudly humming a low note
("Don't touch ANYTHING!" warned {common/creator-name/first}, even though he gave {common/journalist-name/first} as a gift some spare part from the floor that was supposedly an "N-channel MOSFET Block: IRFZ44NPBF * 224"),
into a cyan one, from which they went into a blue corridor (with blinking lights, displays and keyboards lining the walls), 
which, finally, merged into the white room.

'So we can take either the red, green, or blue way out.' - {common/creator-name/first} explained, pointing at each of the corridors connecting to the circular room.

'Uh, any way you like.'

'I'd like the short way out please.' - he said, opening up the map again on his watch, which highlighted a cylinder directly overhead.

'Wait... This isn't one of THOSE rooms, is it?' - he said, walking to the far side of the room and pressing a small grey panel.

The grey panel started flashing between black and white, and, suddenly, the floor dilated, exposing a slowly rising staircase.

'Well, what do you know? It is one of those rooms. Well, there's the fastest way out. After you...' - he said, leading {common/journalist-name/first} to the newly-appeared staircase.

'Eh?? It's leading down!' - he protested, pointing at the staircase, which was, indeed, mostly under the uncovered floor.

'Could you please just stand here and just grab the railing?' - {common/creator-name/first} asked, pointing at the first step.

'O-okay...' -  {common/journalist-name/first} reluctantly agreed, stepping onto the stairs, feeling quite a bit foolish.

'Thanks!~' - {common/creator-name/first} said, walking over to the still-flashing panel.

He pushed it once again, and the staircase began slowly rising upwards. Jumping onto it, he said: 'That's no ordinary staircase. It's more of an elevator.'

Looking down, he saw the floor close behind them, and announced: 'Well, we've passed the first floor.'

'And how many are there?'

'About twenty. Which means we shall now play... the Waiting Game.'
