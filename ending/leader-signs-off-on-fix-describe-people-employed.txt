And so, the city of {common/city-name} continued to be controlled by {common/ai-name}, but less invasively.
Every citizen was issued a headset of the Model TX family, and when they wished to go to work, they would wear it.
Then, they would do what the system told them to do, and they always had the option of declining.
They would get paid based on the time that they were wearing the headset and doing work.
Moreover, {common/ai-name} created humanoid robots for itself, to make work more productive in mission-critical environments.

And all was well.
